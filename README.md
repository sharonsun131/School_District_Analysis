# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:  
The school board found out that there are evidence of academic dishonesty in the students_complete.csv file, so they ask the altered data to be removed and repeat the school district analysis to get a comparison between these two results.    

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

o	How is the district summary affected?


o	How is the school summary affected?

o	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?


o	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

    Scores by school spending

    Scores by school size
